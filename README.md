# GANs with MNIST

## Vanilla Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for MNIST

This is a Python script that implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating MNIST digits using PyTorch. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator, which are trained in an adversarial manner.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- imageio

## Usage

1. Make sure to install the required dependencies.
2. Run the provided code to train the GAN on the MNIST dataset.
3. The script saves the trained generator in 'mnist_generator.pth'.
4. A GIF file ('progress.gif') is generated to visualize the training progress.
5. Losses are plotted and saved in 'loss.png'.

Enjoy generating MNIST digits with your trained GAN!
